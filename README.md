## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced transaction success rate optimization system using **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **real-time inference** to dynamically route and improve financial transaction outcomes. The solution analyzes transaction patterns, predicts success probabilities, and implements optimal routing strategies to maximize success rates.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intelligent Transaction Routing**: Predicts transaction success probability and routes accordingly
- **Real-time Inference API**: FastAPI-based endpoint for integrating with payment systems
- **Advanced ML Models**: XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning approaches
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Comprehensive preprocessing for transaction data
- **Model Retraining**: Continuous learning from new transaction outcomes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Dashboards for tracking model performance and business metrics
- **AWS Deployment**: Containerized deployment to AWS ECS
- **A/B Testing**: Evaluation framework for comparing routing strategies

## 📊 Monitoring and Evaluation

The project includes several monitoring components:

1. **API Health Monitoring**: Real-time checks of endpoint availability and response times
2. **Model Drift Detection**: Identifies when model performance degrades
3. **Transaction Analysis**: Visual dashboards for business metrics
4. **A/B Testing**: Framework for comparing routing strategies

## 💡 Model Architecture

The system employs multiple models:

- **XGBoost Classifier**: Primary model for success prediction
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Dynamic optimization of routing decisions
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Automated transformation of raw transaction data

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The system is evaluated on:

- Transaction success rate improvement
- Precision and recall for fraud detection
- Average response time for real-time predictions
- Business impact metrics (revenue, customer satisfaction)

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

The system implements:

- Feedback loop for model retraining
- Monitoring of prediction vs. actual outcomes
- Concept drift detection
- Automated model retraining when performance degrades
